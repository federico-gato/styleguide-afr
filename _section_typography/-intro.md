This guide explains how to use our typographic styles across The Australian Financial Review. It covers typefaces, sizes, weights, line-heights and tracking recommendations.

## Overview
{: .styleguide-heading}

Sueca is used as our main typeface, supported by Sueca-Sans.
We use a single type hierarchy that is scaled to work across all devices. We change type sizes based on screen size and device
capabilities, such as whether it has a touch screen.
Text is the primary way that users digest content and accomplish work, so itâ€™s important to use good typographic principles to
establish a clear visual hierarchy and to maximize legibility.
