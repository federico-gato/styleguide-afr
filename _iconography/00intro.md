The AFR library of icons is intended to be used across all of AFR.com. The use of icons purely as a stylistic choice is not recommended, they should be used to aid the user understand a particular call to action. These icons are created as scalable vector graphics (SVG’s), previously there were png fallback’s for older browsers but that is being deprecated. Using SVG’s ensures they will look crisp on all devices.
