title: Design components, not ‘pages’
---

This style guide is based largely on the principles of Atomic Design by Brad Frost. The key idea of this methodology is that small, independent - atomic - parts, can be combined into larger molecular structures. Molecules can be combined into larger organisms, which can then serve as the foundation for templates and full pages.

Here’s an example:

The result of this system is a highly reusable list of components that allow designers to create prototypes faster and for developers, code that is easier to manage. By focusing on components instead of pursuing pixel perfect designs, it's easy to see what parts of the site can be reused how they can be mixed and matched to form other molecules and even organisms.
