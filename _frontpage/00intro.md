## The daily habit of effective digital products

This guide is a resource for designers, product managers, and developers, providing a common language around Australian Financial Review design patterns. We use it to maintain modular front-end code and visual harmony across digital touchpoints that reflect the journalistic excellence of Australian Financial Review.

We designed this system to help you create harmonious user experience across digital touchpoints that reflect the journalistic excellence of Australian Financial Review.
