We’ve identified the following principles as unique to Australian Financial Review:

Honourable
We honour the prestige of the brand and its heritage, leaving a good legacy.

Refined
We strive to ensure everything has its place. Elegant and cultured, in appearance and taste.


Tailored
We reward discerning customers with our attention to detail. Respectful of and appealing to them. We craft with purpose.

Distinctive
We are the daily habit of successful people — knowledgeable, influential and without peer. We have a distinguished voice.
