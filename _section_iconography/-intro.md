The AFR library of icons is intended to be used across all of AFR.com. The use of icons purely as a stylistic choice is not recommended, they should be used to aid the user understand a particular call to action. These icons are created as scalable vector graphics (SVG). Using SVG ensures they will look crisp on all devices.
