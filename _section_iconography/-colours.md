title: Colours

Each icon should be bundled into a sprite with a particular colourway. The plan is for icons to be available in grey(sass: $afr-grey), afr blue(sass: $primary-color), $white and $black.

However the social media icons have two colours, grey and the social media's brand colour for hover/focus.

By default when an icon is added it should display as grey. Below is table documenting how to change an icons colour.
